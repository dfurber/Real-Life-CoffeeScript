# I already know JavaScript
* Kudos to you. I do too.
* Not a substitute for knowing JS.
* Your own JS isn't as clean as the compiled JS
* Unless your last name is Resig or Crockford

# It looks weird.
* It's the bastard child of Ruby and Python.
* Once you get used to it, it's the JS that looks whack.

# I don't write JS, I write jQuery. 
* No you write JS using jQuery.
* I use jQuery too.
* CS makes your jQuery cleaner.

# Sugar Allergies 
* Are you allergic to "syntactic sugar"? 
* CS is more than that.
* We need a better name because we all know sugar is bad for you.
* Line Noise Reduction

# Sugar = Noise Reduction 

> Bad line noise highly affects the readability of our code. It is true we get used to them, but once you remove it, there's no way back. - Jose Valim

# Indentation Allergies 
* "I like my curly braces"
* CS uses Pythonic whitespace
* You get used to it - cost/benefit
* > I really don't understand why using indentation level for blocks is so controversial. You do indentation anyway; you don't want to violate OAOO; it avoids hard-to-spot errors where indentation and begin/end or {/} differ; it looks cleaner; there's no way to have unmatched braces; and I never get indentation wrong, but sometimes I do have to count braces. In other words, don't let this issue stop you from trying out Python; indentation-denoted blocks are very easy to get used to. -- Falk Bruegmann

# Firebug Will Break 
* You lose the correspondence between your code and line numbers in Firebug
* There is no FireCoffee
* Use small coffee files to get approximate line correspondence
* The compiled JS is not magical - you can still read it

# What about syntax highlighting? 
* No plugin for Eclipse/Aptana
* Use TextMate, jEdit, gEdit, vim, emacs
* The TextMate bundle is great!

# Maybe on the next project 
* Unless your current project is almost done and will never be maintained...
* Porting that project is just what you need to learn CS.
* It's not "all or nothing": one file at a time
* If you don't like it you can keep the change.

# Where do I start? 
* Don't just dive in or you'll be coding before you're ready
* Read the CS overview a few times (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script)
* Install CS and the TextMate bundle
* Port a project's JS to CS
* Write some new CS code
