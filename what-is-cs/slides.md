# What is CoffeeScript? #
* CS is a language that compiles into JavaScript (like HAML and SASS)
* Not a superset of JS (not like SCSS)
* Not a JS framework (not a replacement for jQuery)

# From the maker #
> CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way. - Josh Ashkenas

# Why all the fuss? #
* CS will be a standard part of Rails 3.1 (along with SASS)
* It makes JS more like Ruby!
* CS is an npm package, hence a gateway drug to Node.js and Socket.IO

!SLIDE bullets incremental left
# Why use CS? #
* compiles to lint-free JS, nothing fancy
* easy to write "good parts javascript" that looks clean
* makes good practices less tedious
* HAML and SASS are awesome and now you're using those...
